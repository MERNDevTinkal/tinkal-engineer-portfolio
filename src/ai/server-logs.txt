  "response": "## Part 1: System Design\nThe complete architecture for a real-time chat application like WhatsApp that supports 1 million concurrent users will consist of the following components:\n* Frontend: A mobile or web application built using React, Angular, or Vue.js that allows users to interact with the chat application.\n* Backend: A server-side application built using Node.js, Java, or Python that handles user authentication, message processing, and database interactions.\n* Database: A relational database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL that stores user information, chat history, and message data.\n* Load Balancer: A load balancer like HAProxy or NGINX that distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure scalability and high availability.\n* Caching: A caching layer like Redis or Memcached that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the database and improve performance.\n* Message Queue: A message queue like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka that handles message processing and delivery to ensure that messages are delivered in real-time.\n* WebSocket Scaling: A WebSocket scaling solution like Socket.io or WebSocket-Node that allows the application to handle a large number of concurrent WebSocket connections.\n\nThe flow of messages in the system will work as follows:\n1. A user sends a message from their mobile or web application.\n2. The message is received by the load balancer, which directs it to one of the available backend servers.\n3. The backend server processes the message and stores it in the database.\n4. The message is then added to the message queue, which handles message delivery to the recipient's device.\n5. The recipient's device receives the message via a WebSocket connection, which ensures real-time delivery.\n\nReal-time delivery works by using WebSockets, which allow the server to push messages to the client in real-time. When a user sends a message, the server adds it to the message queue, which then delivers the message to the recipient's device via a WebSocket connection.\n\nOffline messages work by storing messages in the database when the recipient is offline. When the recipient comes online, the server delivers the stored messages to their device via a WebSocket connection.\n\n## Part 2: Database Design\nThe database schema for the chat application will consist of the following tables:\n* Users table: stores user information, including user ID, username, and password.\n* Chats table: stores chat history, including chat ID, user ID, and message ID.\n* Messages table: stores message data, including message ID, chat ID, user ID, and message text.\n\nThe indexing strategy for the database will include the following indexes:\n* Primary key index on the user ID column in the Users table.\n* Primary key index on the chat ID column in the Chats table.\n* Primary key index on the message ID column in the Messages table.\n* Foreign key index on the user ID column in the Chats table that references the user ID column in the Users table.\n* Foreign key index on the chat ID column in the Messages table that references the chat ID column in the Chats table.\n\nTo handle billions of messages, the database will be designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to the database cluster. This will allow the database to handle increased traffic and store large amounts of data.\n\n## Part 3: Scaling Problem\nIf the server CPU suddenly reaches 100%, the issue can be identified by monitoring server performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency. The issue can be fixed by adding more servers to the cluster, optimizing database queries, and implementing caching to reduce the load on the database.\n\nTo prevent future issues, the system can be designed to scale automatically based on traffic demands. This can be achieved by using cloud providers like AWS or Google Cloud, which offer auto-scaling features that allow the system to scale up or down based on traffic demands.\n\n## Part 4: DevOps + AWS\nThe chat application can be deployed on AWS using the following services:\n* EC2 or Kubernetes: for deploying and managing backend servers.\n* Load Balancer: for distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.\n* Auto Scaling: for scaling the system up or down based on traffic demands.\n* Database: for storing user information, chat history, and message data.\n* Redis: for caching frequently accessed data.\n* Monitoring: for monitoring server performance metrics and detecting issues.\n\nThe deployment process will involve the following steps:\n1. Creating an EC2 instance or Kubernetes cluster for deploying the backend servers.\n2. Configuring the load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.\n3. Setting up auto-scaling to scale the system up or down based on traffic demands.\n4. Creating a database instance for storing user information, chat history, and message data.\n5. Configuring Redis for caching frequently accessed data.\n6. Setting up monitoring tools to monitor server performance metrics and detect issues.\n\n## Part 5: Coding Problem\nHere is an example of Node.js code for a WebSocket server that handles multiple users, sending messages, and receiving messages:\n```javascript\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws) => {\n  console.log('Client connected');\n\n  ws.on('message', (message) => {\n    console.log(`Received message => ${message}`);\n    ws.send(`Server received your message: ${message}`);\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    console.log('Client disconnected');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Part 6: Failure Scenario\nIf the database crashes, the system can recover without data loss by using a combination of database replication and backup strategies. Here are the steps to recover the system:\n1. Identify the issue: Monitor database performance metrics to detect the issue.\n2. Failover to a replica: Switch to a replica database to ensure that the system remains available.\n3. Restore from backup: Restore the database from a backup to ensure that all data is recovered.\n4. Verify data integrity: Verify that all data is intact and that the system is functioning correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, the system can recover from a database crash without data loss and ensure that the chat application remains available to users.",

  "response": "To redesign the system to support 100 million users globally with 50ms latency, we would need to make significant changes to the architecture. Here are some steps we could take:\n1. **Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Implement a global CDN to distribute static content, such as images and videos, across multiple edge locations. This would reduce the latency for users accessing static content.\n2. **Edge Computing**: Implement edge computing to process user requests closer to the user's location. This would reduce the latency for user requests and improve the overall user experience.\n3. **Distributed Database**: Implement a distributed database that can handle high traffic and large amounts of data. This would ensure that the database can handle the increased load and provide low latency for user requests.\n4. **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers. This would ensure that no single server is overwhelmed and that users experience low latency.\n5. **Caching**: Implement caching to store frequently accessed data. This would reduce the load on the database and provide low latency for user requests.\n6. **Optimize Database Queries**: Optimize database queries to reduce the load on the database and provide low latency for user requests.\n7. **Use a Message Queue**: Use a message queue to handle asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications and processing user requests. This would reduce the load on the servers and provide low latency for user requests.\n8. **Implement Auto Scaling**: Implement auto scaling to automatically add or remove servers based on traffic demands. This would ensure that the system can handle changes in traffic and provide low latency for user requests.\n9. **Use a Cloud Provider**: Use a cloud provider, such as AWS or Google Cloud, to take advantage of their scalable infrastructure and low latency networks.\n10. **Monitor and Optimize**: Monitor the system and optimize it regularly to ensure that it is running efficiently and providing low latency for user requests.\nBy following these steps, we can redesign the system to support 100 million users globally with 50ms latency.",
